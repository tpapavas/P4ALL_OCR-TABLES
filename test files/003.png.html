V4 DATABASE RELATIONSHIPS <br>This document outlines the primary tables in the V4 database. For each table, the <br>intended purpose, the signiﬁcant key columns and suggested relationship to other tables is <br>provided. The format of the content will mirror the following: <br>TABLE NAME (Primary Key Columns) <br>Purpose and data items of interest <br>Recommended relationship criteria <br>*IF*IF1”}:16************************* ** ** ** ** ** ** ** *******************************$ <br>PARCEL (SWIS_CO, SWIS_TOWN, SWIS_VG, PARCEL_]D) <br>Data items relate to parcel speciﬁc data that spans assessment roll years, i.e. print key, grid <br>coordinates, parcel address. <br>Parcel table is the primary ‘target’ table in most situations and will be referred to in that manner. <br>For a list of all print keys within a municipality, parcel table may be queried by SWIS code. <br>ASSESSMENT (SWIS_CO, SWIS_TOWN, SWIS_VG, PARCEL_ID, ROLL_YR) <br>Data items relate to speciﬁc assessment roll year settings, i.e. roll section, property class, <br>assessed values for land and total, taxable values for county, municipality, village and school, <br>school code, active code. <br>Assessment table is related to parcel via SWIS_CO, SWIS_TOWN, SWIS_VG and <br>PARCEL_ID. Data for a given assessment roll can be gathered by including ROLL_YR in <br>selection criteria. Many of the reporting functions in V4 utilize active code to distinguish parcels <br>as useful, i.e. ACTIVE_CODE where ‘A’ active, ‘D’ inactive (deleted), ‘R’ reactivated, ‘H’ <br>historical. <br>Further, several data items on this table have related reference tables that provide decode <br>information and are listed here in part: <br>
